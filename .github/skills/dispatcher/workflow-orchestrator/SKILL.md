# Dispatcher Workflow Orchestrator (AMS)

Copilot integration note: use Dispatcher MCP tools only when those tools are configured. If not available, orchestrate static repo validation and local build checks, and call out missing runtime evidence.

Use this skill when users need end-to-end Dispatcher support instead of a single specialist workflow.

## Scope

- Full lifecycle orchestration for AMS Dispatcher work:
  - requirements and design
  - config implementation and hardening
  - static/runtime validation
  - release readiness and rollback planning
  - production incident triage

## Routing Model

1. Start in `config-authoring` for file design and edits.
2. Pull in `technical-advisory` for policy, documentation, and evidence planning.
3. Pull in `security-hardening` and `performance-tuning` for non-functional risk checks.
4. Switch to `incident-response` for live failures or regressions.
5. Return a single consolidated output: changes, evidence, risk, rollback, and follow-ups.

## Operational Packaging

Use these shared references to keep broad requests deterministic:

1. Start with [quick-start-execution-path.md](./references/dispatcher-foundation/quick-start-execution-path.md) when the user is new, the repo root is ambiguous, or the request spans multiple concerns.
2. Normalize the repo to a dispatcher `src` root with [repo-layout-workflows.md](./references/dispatcher-foundation/repo-layout-workflows.md).
3. Convert the chosen specialist playbook into exact MCP commands with [playbook-command-linkage.md](./references/dispatcher-foundation/playbook-command-linkage.md).
4. Use the specialist skill references only after the path above is fixed.

## Entry Criteria

Use when user intent is any of:
- end-to-end implementation
- pre-release readiness review
- troubleshooting + fix + re-validation in one flow
- broad audit across config, security, and performance

## Exit Criteria

Always return:
- touched files and why
- executed checks (static + runtime) and evidence
- unresolved risks/gaps
- rollback trigger + rollback action
- next-step plan if prerequisites blocked verification
